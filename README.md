## Hi 👋 I'm Daniel

🔭 I'm working on program analysis (I like to instrument systems) and smart regression test selection (I like to save testing effort in CI pipelines)

💻 I mostly code in Java, C++, TypeScript, Python, and Go and I'm currently leveling up my C++ and Go game 🎮

🏗️ I enjoy engineering solutions for full-stack problems from frontend 🪄 to production deployment 🚢

💬 Ask me about program analysis and regression testing in multi-language software (story of my PhD...)

📬 If you're interested in having a chat about any of the tools I've (co-)developed (see my pinnings), feel free to <a href="mailto:dvelsner@gmail.com">hit me up</a>!
